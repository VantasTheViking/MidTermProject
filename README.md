ToonShader uses Textures with a toon ramp. It also has less steps in the ramp as I see that the game only has two steps in trees. I also used a colour property so i could modify the colour of the texture and a strength multiplier to make it more brighter or less, mainly for customizability and easier for me to get a good look.
I used BlinnPhong as for the reflection since I mainly just needed specular, and that since this is an old game I thought it was appropriate to use a more efficient reflection compared to phong. Lastly, I modified it by giving a strength multiplier to the specular to make the water and glass seem more reflective.
